    Adjusts a given multiplier based on external conditions such as energy level, temperature, and resilience.

    This function applies weighting to a base multiplier, allowing it to be influenced by multiple factors:
    - Energy: Higher energy reduces penalties, while lower energy increases them.
    - Temperature: Deviations from a reference temperature introduce penalties.
    - Resilience: Acts as a resistance factor to counteract penalties.

    If `inverse_effect` is set to True, the effects are reversed (i.e., instead of reducing penalties, they increase).
